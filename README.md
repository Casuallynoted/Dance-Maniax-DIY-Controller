# Dance-Maniax-DIY-Controller
A DIY solution for creating a Dance Maniax controller, I wound up spending less than $40-50 on the whole thing.

# Requirements:
-Teensy 2.0 (This is what I used, but any microcontroller/arduino could theoretically be used for this)
-Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F GP2Y0A21 (can also be used with other IR sensors from Sharp but this one has the farthest range)
-Soldering iron and solder
-A computer to program the microcontroller, but if you're using Stepmania you probably already have this!

Optional, but always great to have:
-The Teensy 2.0 board uses a mini usb cable to connect to a computer but doesn't include one in the box. Other controllers may require different cable types so do your research!
-I wound up deciding to get Male to Female jumper cables to extend the sensors further out than the provided cables do. I used the ones here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XRV92ZB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
-Respirator, no solder fumes for me!
-Helping Hands to hold the board while soldering (and while it was still in the DIY phase this doubled as my controller stand for a while)

Instructions coming soon! Next commit!
